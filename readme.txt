Welcome! This is the first build of my little open-source project, SpriteBoard!

SpriteBoard is a program that displays images in a conveyor belt fashion. Useful for showcasing ads on livestreams or consulting references for artists.

To use SpriteBoard simply drop your images in the program directory and adjust the settings in the text file to your liking (you can also import a custom font by dropping a .ttf file on the same folder). The image format must be PNG.
While the program is in focus, use the left mouse click to drag the images around and the right mouse click to move the window. Whenever you import new images, you'll need to refresh the board by pressing the MULTIPLY key on your numpad (works even when the program is not in focus), or press R to reboot it. Pressing the ESCAPE key will close the program.

SpriteBoard also has basic support for animated images! To animate an image, use an image editing program to place the frames next to each other horizontally. Then, rename your file according to this format:

-Everything before the tilde will be ignored.
-"f" indicates the number of frames the image has.
-"s" indicates the speed at which the animation should be played (frames per second).

Hope you enjoy this little experiment!
